This question is answered by the role-based authorization system, which grant different permissions to users in different roles. 

It is only permitted to users with Editor or Admin roles to submit data. For further information, please visit the Organisations section of this site or visit the [official CKAN documentation](https://docs.ckan.org/en/2.11/user-guide.html#managing-an-organization).
