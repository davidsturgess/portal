title: What data licences does TDC offer?
category: data_licences

The TDC Portal promotes the use of licenses developed by the [Creative Commons Foundation](http://creativecommons.org/) and the [Open Data Foundation](http://opendatacommons.org/). The main difference between the two classes of licences is that the Creative Commons licences were developed for sharing creative works in general, while the Open Data Commons licences were developed more specifically for sharing databases. The full list of licences is provided on the data submission form.
