It is always possible to editors and admins to modify the datasets pertaining to their organisation. To do this, please access the My Organisation Datasets tab on the Dashboard. Select the dataset you want to modify and navigate through the form to find the specific field you want to edit. Save your changes as draft or submit the edited dataset. 

Datasets edited by users must be approved by an **admin** before they can be published on the TDC Portal. If you hold the admin role for your organisation, you will receive an email notification whenever a user made changes to data from your organisation. The dataset will appear in the **Dataset Approval** section of your Dashboard for review.
