As an urban geographer and a passionate cyclist, I have always been interested in transport and mobility. I am driven by a vision of sustainable mobility that enhances both the quality of human life and of the natural environment.
Having lived in different cities around the world, I highly value international exchange and cooperation. I am convinced that global challenges require cooperative solutions. I am thus glad to support the TraCS project team in aligning transport and climate action plans in emerging economies and developing countries.
