I am a Research Scholar at IIASA in the Energy, Climate, and Environment program. My research focuses on transportation demand growth in economies worldwide; consequent energy demand and environmental impacts; and technology and policy options for sustainable mobility.
I am interested in data, methods, and models that can be used to understand emerging technologies, new policies, and uncertain trends in transport. These assessments inform decisions in pursuit of climate, environmental, and economic goals. In particular, I believe that the trajectories of China, India, and other emerging/transition economies will be decisive and informative as we seek to make transport compatible with global sustainability. I also see O/FAIR practices as essential to the equity of systemic change in transport systems, because they reduce barriers and allow stakeholders to have direct ownership of processes of measurement, modeling, and assessment. To these ends, I am a co-organizer of the iTEM consortium and active in developing and promoting open source research software for data handling and modeling.
